public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = in.nextInt();
        int num=0,wrap=0;
        for(int a0 = 0; a0 < t; a0++){
            num=0;
            wrap=0;
            int n = in.nextInt();//total cash
            int c = in.nextInt();//cost of one choc
            int m = in.nextInt();//min threshold for n=n+1
            num=(n/c);
            
            wrap=num;
            while(wrap>=m){
                wrap=wrap-m;
                num++;
                wrap++;
            }
            
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
